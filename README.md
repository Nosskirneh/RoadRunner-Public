# Translate RoadRunner
It was a requested feature to have RoadRunner's preference panel translated.

Do you know a language that RoadRunner isn't translated to yet and want to contribute? First make sure that the language is not already translated and uploaded [here](https://github.com/Nosskirneh/RoadRunner-Public/blob/master/translations). Refer to the [English translation]([API.md](https://github.com/Nosskirneh/RoadRunner-Public/blob/master/translations/en.lproj)) within this repo. Copy its folder, change its name to your [country's code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (see column 639-1) and translate the `Localizable.strings` file. Zip it and send me the zip somehow (email adress can be found within the settings panel) or open a pull request to this repo.
